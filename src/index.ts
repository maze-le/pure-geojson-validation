  /**
   * A bounding box is geographic 'fence' around a feature or geometry. It is
   * valid when it is a numbered array with 4 or 6 coordinate values. The
   * coordinates run from the southwesterly point to the northeasterly point.
   *
   * Lat coordinate values must be between -180째 and 180째.
   * Lon coordinate values must be between -90째 and 90째.
   * The 2 other numbers in the array represent 3D Bounding Boxes and are not checked.
   *
   *     [SW_Lat, SW_Lon, NE_Lat, NE_Lon, ...]
   *
   * @returns Just(BBox) if bbox is a valid bounding box.
   * @returns Nothing if bbox is invalid.
   * @see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946
